Overview:
News Web is a news website that fetches live news articles and displays them in real-time. It uses a news API to deliver the latest headlines to users, offering features such as a search bar to filter results and a fully functional navigation bar for easy browsing. Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website showcases modern web development techniques while maintaining a clean, responsive design.

Key Features:
1) Live News Fetching:
  The website dynamically fetches live news data from a news API and displays the latest headlines, giving users real-time access to current events.
2) Search Functionality:
  The website includes a working search bar that allows users to search for specific news topics. As users type, the website filters the displayed news articles based on the search query.
3) Dynamic Navigation Bar:
  The navbar is fully functional, allowing users to navigate between different sections of the website, such as categories or regions, without any page reloads.
4) Responsive Design:
  The website is responsive, thanks to the use of media queries, ensuring that it looks and functions well on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
5) Simple and Clean UI:
  The user interface is designed with simplicity in mind, providing a clutter-free experience where users can easily find and read the news that interests them.

This project provided a great opportunity to apply JavaScript for real-world applications like API fetching, and it also enhanced my understanding of how to make websites responsive with media queries. It taught me how to combine front-end development skills to build practical, user-friendly websites.
